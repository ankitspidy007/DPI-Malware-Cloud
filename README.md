Research paper will be uploaded soon.
 we will be discussing different techniques for detecting malwares over encrypted channel on cloud based environment. Lots of work have been done in this area in recent years by major companies. The research is mainly focused on encryption techniques like SSL/TLS and Homomorphic Encryption techniques. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), Machine Learning based algorithm techniques will be discussed in this paper. The methods are comparedwitheachotheraccordingtotheirtechniques,features, datasets, and limitation. This paper aims for a comprehensive study and review of malware detection techniques.
